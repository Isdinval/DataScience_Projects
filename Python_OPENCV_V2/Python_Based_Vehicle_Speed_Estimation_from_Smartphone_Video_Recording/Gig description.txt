*Project Objectives:* The goal is to create Python-based server-side code API that takes a video footage taken from the rear camera of an Android smartphone as input, and estimates the speed of the vehicle. The estimated speed should be accurate within a margin of 10% error.

*Inputs:*
1. A single video recording captured through an Android smartphone's rear camera, available in .mp4 format.
2. Vertical field of view of the camera (measured as an angle).

*Expected Output:* Vehicle's speed (displayed on the console or saved to a file)

*Preconditions (assumptions):*
1. The vehicle is moving along a straight path.
2. The smartphone camera is fixed and immune to any form of movement (shakes, rotations, etc.).
3. The vehicle maintains a constant speed throughout the video recording.
4. The dimensions of the vehicle's license plate are accurately known beforehand.
5. Only a single vehicle is featured in the video recording with no other moving entities in the backdrop.
6. The video frame rate is maintained at 30 FPS.
7. The video quality is 720P or higher.

*Evaluation Criteria:* The developed code should offer an estimated speed that falls within a 10% error margin of the actual speed. This should hold true for both the provided and unseen footage that bear similarity in aspects like quality, angle, lighting conditions, etc.

*Project Timeline:* Do provide an estimated delivery date for the project.

*Support:* If you require assistance with designing a strategy, feel free to contact us. Please note that for development purposes, 20 video recordings along with their actual speeds will be provided.

*Further Instructions:* The Python code developed will be executed on backend servers. A concise readme document detailing the setup procedure, code description, and strategy explanation should be provided along with the code.
