# Title: Pinterest Pin Uploader Automation Script

## Description:
This Python script automates the process of uploading pins to Pinterest, a popular social media platform for sharing images and ideas. The script utilizes the Selenium library to interact with the Pinterest website, Colorama for console text formatting, and the JSON and CSV libraries for reading pin data from files.

## Key Features:

### Data Reading and Extraction: 
The script includes a Data class that can read and extract pin data from both JSON and CSV files. The class stores essential information such as the pinboard name, file path, title, description, alt text, link, and optional scheduling date. It performs various checks on the data to ensure its validity.

### Web Automation: 
The Pinterest class is the main class responsible for web automation. It starts a new Chrome webdriver using the undetected_chromedriver, and it allows users to log in to their Pinterest account using their email and password.

### Uploading Pins: 
The script allows users to upload pins one by one to Pinterest. It navigates to the pin upload page, fills in the required information, and uploads the pin image. Users can set an optional date and time for scheduled pin publishing.

### File Selection: 
The script provides options for users to select data files (JSON, CSV, or XLSX) either from the 'data' folder or by browsing their computer. The 'Data' class is flexible enough to handle different file formats.

### Colorama Integration: 
The script leverages the Colorama module for text color formatting in the console. The colored output enhances the user experience by providing clear feedback on various actions, such as successful logins and pin uploads.

## Potential Use Case:
This automation script is valuable for Pinterest users who frequently upload multiple pins to their account. It streamlines the pin uploading process, ensuring that all necessary data is provided and that the pins are uploaded accurately. This can save time and effort for individuals or businesses with a significant presence on Pinterest.

## Note:
The script requires the installation of certain Python libraries, such as Selenium, Colorama, and undetected_chromedriver. Additionally, users need to have a compatible version of the Chrome browser installed and provide valid Pinterest login credentials for successful execution.
