The provided code consists of three Python scripts that showcase different functionalities related to web automation, file handling, and text analysis. These scripts collectively demonstrate the candidate's proficiency in web scraping, data manipulation, and text processing, making them valuable for data science-related tasks.

# CODE1: Web Automation and Image Upload Bot
CODE1 is an automation script designed to interact with the Redbubble platform using Selenium WebDriver. The script utilizes the undetected_chromedriver library to perform browser automation without detection. It allows users to upload images to Redbubble in bulk, automating the repetitive image submission process. The bot features a user-friendly graphical interface implemented with tkinter, enabling easy selection of folders containing image files. The script demonstrates the candidate's expertise in web scraping, handling dynamic web elements, and managing browser sessions. Recruiters can see that the candidate is proficient in web automation and has experience working with real-world web applications.

# CODE2: Image Renaming Script
CODE2 is a script that renames image files based on titles provided in a text file. The script reads image titles from a specified text file and renames each image in the target folder accordingly. It ensures that the number of titles matches the number of images before proceeding with the renaming process. Additionally, it removes any empty lines from the text file to avoid issues during renaming. This script demonstrates the candidate's ability to handle file operations, folder manipulation, and bulk renaming tasks. Recruiters can observe that the candidate is skilled in managing files and directories efficiently.

# CODE3: Word Frequency Analysis
CODE3 performs word frequency analysis on titles provided in a text file. It calculates the frequency of individual words while excluding specific words listed in the "excluded_words" variable. The script uses the collections.Counter class to count the occurrences of each word, providing a summary of the most common words used in the titles. This script showcases the candidate's competence in text processing, data analysis, and data exploration techniques. Recruiters can infer that the candidate possesses strong skills in handling textual data and conducting basic data analysis.

# Conclusion
In summary, these Python scripts collectively exhibit the candidate's capabilities in web automation, file handling, and text analysis. The candidate's proficiency in web scraping, data manipulation, and text processing make them well-suited for data science tasks that involve data extraction, preprocessing, and exploration. These scripts can be valuable assets to recruiters seeking candidates with expertise in automating web interactions, managing files and folders, and performing basic text analysis for data science projects.
